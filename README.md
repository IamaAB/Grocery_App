# grocery_tute

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


The provided code represents a shopping application with three main pages. The first page is the "Get Started" page, which presumably serves as an entry point for users to start shopping. The second page is the "Home" page, where users can view and manage items in their shopping cart. This page dynamically displays the contents of the cart, allowing users to remove items if needed. The third page is the "Checkout" page, where users can review their selected items and view the total bill. This page likely provides an option for users to proceed with payment. Overall, the application offers a seamless shopping experience, guiding users from exploring products to managing their cart and completing their purchase.
